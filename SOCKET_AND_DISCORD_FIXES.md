# Socket Connection & Discord Webhook Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Discord Webhook Error
**Problem**: Bug reports were failing with `TypeError: Failed to parse URL from your_discord_webhook_url_here`

**Root Cause**: The environment variable `DISCORD_BUG_WEBHOOK_URL` was set to a placeholder value instead of a real webhook URL or being empty.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the bug report API (`pages/api/bug-report.ts`) to validate webhook URLs
- Added checks to ensure the webhook URL:
  - Is not the placeholder value `your_discord_webhook_url_here`
  - Starts with `https://` (valid URL format)
  - Only attempts Discord notification if all conditions are met
- Created a setup script (`scripts/setup-discord-webhook.js`) to help users configure Discord webhooks
- Added npm script `setup-discord` for easy webhook configuration

### 2. Socket Connection Instability
**Problem**: Rapid connect/disconnect cycles causing connection spam in logs

**Root Cause**: Socket.io configuration was too aggressive with short timeouts and intervals, causing unnecessary reconnections.

**Solutions Applied**:

#### Server-Side Improvements (`pages/api/socket.ts`):
- **Increased ping timeout**: 60s → 120s (2 minutes) for better stability
- **Increased ping interval**: 25s → 30s to reduce network overhead
- **Increased connect timeout**: 30s → 45s to allow more time for connections
- **Added connection state recovery**: Helps maintain connection state across brief disconnections
- **Enhanced compression settings**: Better performance for message handling

#### Client-Side Improvements (`pages/_app.tsx`):
- **Reduced reconnection attempts**: 10 → 5 to prevent connection spam
- **Increased reconnection delays**: 2s-10s → 3s-15s for more stable reconnection
- **Added randomization factor**: 0.5 to prevent thundering herd problems
- **Increased timeout**: 30s → 45s to match server configuration
- **Added session ID management**: Helps with connection state recovery

## Configuration Files

### Environment Setup
- `.env.local` is now properly managed by the setup script
- Discord webhook URL validation prevents parsing errors
- Empty webhook URL gracefully disables Discord notifications

### NPM Scripts
- `npm run setup-discord`: Interactive Discord webhook configuration
- Existing scripts remain unchanged

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Discord Webhook Test**:
   ```bash
   # Configure Discord webhook (optional)
   npm run setup-discord
   
   # Start server and test bug report
   npm run dev
   # Submit a bug report through the UI - should not show parsing errors
   ```

2. **Socket Connection Test**:
   ```bash
   # Start server
   npm run dev
   
   # Monitor logs - should see fewer connect/disconnect cycles
   # Connections should be more stable with longer intervals
   ```

## Benefits

### Stability Improvements
- Reduced connection churn and log spam
- Better handling of temporary network issues
- More resilient to brief disconnections

### User Experience
- Smoother gameplay with fewer connection interruptions
- Better error handling for Discord notifications
- Easy setup process for Discord integration

### Performance
- Reduced server load from excessive reconnections
- Better compression and message handling
- Optimized ping intervals reduce network overhead

## Monitoring

Watch for these improvements in the logs:
- Fewer "Socket connected/disconnected" messages
- No more Discord webhook parsing errors
- More stable connection patterns
- Successful Discord notifications (if configured)

## Future Considerations

- Monitor connection patterns in production
- Consider implementing connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios
- Add metrics collection for connection stability analysis
- Implement graceful degradation for network issues
