## 🎮 How to Play Fodinha

Fodinha is a **round-based trick-taking card game** with betting mechanics and elimination by lives. It's strategic, social, and gets more intense as the rounds progress.

### 🧠 Objective
Predict the number of **tricks** (round wins) you'll win each round. Get it wrong, and you lose lives.

### 🃏 Game Rules

#### ♣️♦️♥️♠️ Card Suits and Order
- The game uses a **40-card deck** with the following suits: ♣ Clubs, ♥ Hearts, ♠ Spades, ♦ Diamonds
- **Card Value Order** (lowest to highest): 4, 5, 6, 7, Q, J, K, A, 2, 3
- **Manilha Cards**: When a card is drawn to determine the manilha, the manilha value is the next card in the sequence (e.g., if 7 is drawn, Q is the manilha value)
- **Manilha Suit Ranking** (when comparing manilha cards): Clubs (highest), Hearts, Spades, Diamonds (lowest)
- **Tie-Breaking Suit Ranking** (used only to break ties in final rounds): Clubs (highest), Hearts, Spades, Diamonds (lowest)

#### 🪙 Starting Conditions
- Each player starts with **3 lives**
- In round 1, each player receives **1 card**
- The number of cards **increases each round**, then decreases again (like a bell curve)
- A random card determines the **manilha** (trump suit) each round

#### 🔮 Betting Phase
- Before playing, players bet how many tricks they expect to win
- Bets are made one player at a time
- **The last player to bet cannot guess the exact number needed to equal all tricks combined** (to prevent balanced bets)

#### ♠️ Playing Cards
- Players take turns playing one card per trick
- The **highest card** wins the trick
- Manilha (trump) cards **beat all other cards**, regardless of suit
- If two cards tie in value, **both are cancelled**
- If a trick is cancelled and nobody wins it, the **next trick is worth double**

#### 🎯 Scoring & Lives
- After all tricks are played, compare the number of tricks each player won to their bet
- For each trick you miss your bet by, **you lose that many lives**
- A player with **0 lives is eliminated**
- The last remaining player wins

#### 👁️ Special First-Round Rule
- In round 1, **you cannot see your own card**
- However, you **can see all other players' cards**

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### ✅ Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Sign up at [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Connect your GitHub account to Vercel
4. Import this project repository
5. Click **Deploy**

⚠️ **Important Production Notes**: 
- The default implementation uses in-memory storage for production which has limitations:
  - Game data resets if the Vercel instance restarts
  - Memory is not shared between serverless functions
  - Instances may freeze after 10-15 minutes of inactivity
- For a more robust production setup, consider using:
  - Vercel KV (Redis-based storage)
  - MongoDB Atlas
  - Supabase
  - Or any other persistent database service

### 🖥️ Option 2: Run Locally

#### Requirements
- Node.js installed on your machine
  
#### Steps
